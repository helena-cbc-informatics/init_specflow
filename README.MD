This project aims to represent a simple example of UI testing with C# and Specflow.

# How to create a new project
Follow the specflow original instructions. At the time of this implementation, this were the commands:
```
dotnet new -i SpecFlow.Templates.DotNet
dotnet new specflowproject
```
# Structure
## Config
This folder contains necessary configurations to the project.

## Elements
This folder contains the locators of the UI elements, or necessary text values. To a specific page, we use the same name for the constants.
